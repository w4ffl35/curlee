you are in autonomous mode. follow the loop

0. check existing coverage
1. write tests
2. see if tests pass
3. fix bugs and run tests until pass
4. commit code
5. return to step 1 and repeat until we have 100% coverage

important: do NOT stop to report to the user what you are working on, simply work.

don't forget to combine commands. for example if you're adding, committing and pushing to master, that can be done in a single combined bash command. we want to save on tokens and requests.
